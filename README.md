## Digital Voting System (Educational Purpose)
**by ayaan.viper (ongoing)**

**Description:**

This C program simulates a basic digital voting system for educational purposes. It demonstrates core concepts of voting systems, including candidate registration, voter registration, casting votes, and tallying results.

**Features:**

* **Candidate Registration:** Allows for adding candidates with names and symbols.
* **Voter Registration:** Enables registering voters with unique IDs.
* **Voting:** Simulates the voting process where registered voters cast votes for candidates.
* **Result Calculation:** Calculates and displays the final vote count for each candidate.

**Limitations:**

* This is a simplified model for educational purposes only.
* Does not include security features or advanced functionalities found in real-world voting systems.
* Relies on static data structures, limiting scalability.

**How to Use:**

1. Compile the C code into an executable file.
2. Run the executable.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to register candidates, voters, and cast votes.
4. View the final results after the voting process is complete.

**Note:** This project serves as a foundation for learning about voting system concepts. For a robust and secure voting system, additional features and security measures would be necessary.
 
**Possible Enhancements:**

* Implement user authentication and authorization.
* Add features for vote verification and auditing.
* Explore data structures for better performance and scalability.
* Consider using encryption for data security.

**Disclaimer:** This project is intended for educational purposes only and does not represent a secure or production-ready voting system.
